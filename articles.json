If they earn more than that, they'll need their own health insurance and can get a personal recommendation <a href=\"https://app.feather-insurance.com/recommendation-tool\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Medical requirements</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">With the following health conditions and treatments, it is not possible to get private health coverage: asthma, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, cancer, diabetes, ADHD, mental health conditions, and recent or longer-term psychotherapy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For other diagnoses, we're happy to check the options once the application is handed in.</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Proof of insurance or medical check-up </b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For all 12 months prior to the application and the start date of their new private coverage, you and every dependent must have had comprehensive coverage.

To help with the decision-making, we've listed the main differences below!</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Under public health insurance, your children and your spouse or life partner can be covered for free, as long as they earn less than €470 per month. Under private health insurance, there is a monthly contribution for every added person. However, private health coverage offers more benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Travel coverage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Better dental coverage: orthodontics for children, dental cleanings, inlays, and dentures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Faster medical appointments: most doctors and pediatricians reserve appointments for private insurance patients.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Access to any doctor and clinic: many clinics and doctors only cater to patients with private health coverage. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Coverage for vision aids (only in some plans)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Coverage for alternative medicine (only in some plans)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Other benefits, depending on the package you chose </p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_dbc441be9a\">All about pregnancy </h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_129d36993b\">Pregnancy coverage in public and private health insurance</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Germany takes good care of expecting mothers. That's why the coverage is more or less congruent between public and private health insurance. Benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">medical examinations and consultation from your GP and gynecologists, blood tests, ultrasound examinations, and preventative examinations to test for risks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">a midwife (although it is more difficult to find one on public health insurance)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">birth preparation courses, pregnancy gymnastics, and postnatal gymnastics. </p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">Whether or not IVF is covered depends on the provider and insurance plan.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_875625b68e\">You can get covered if you are already pregnant! </h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Yes, you can still get private health insurance, if you are already pregnant. Treatments for the pregnancy, the early detection of illnesses, midwives, and delivery are covered. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_e4c90075b2\">When to get coverage for a newborn</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Since you have more important things to worry about, we'll help you get the right coverage for your baby.

Can I still get coverage right away? </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>1. What are waiting periods?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Waiting periods are the time between the start date of your health insurance and the moment you can benefit from your coverage. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Waiting periods exist to ensure that the health cover is not abused. Let’s have a look at an example: someone wants to do some dental treatment and signs up for health insurance to go to the dentist on the same day. The insurance provider would have to carry a high amount of costs right away. Had they known that the person had dental issues, they might have adapted the coverage (as private insurances adapt the cover based on the medical history). </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If a couple of people like that join the insurance, the monthly payments of the community would skyrocket. By having waiting periods, insurers make sure that the coverage is adapted to the actual needs of each person, and this means everyone can make a fair contribution.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>2. How long are the waiting periods?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are different types of waiting periods for every health insurance policy. Here, we will focus on the waiting periods on our Standard and Premium plans under private health insurance. There are two types of waiting periods:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">3 months: General waiting period for all types of claims</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">8 months: Special waiting period for claims involving childbirth, psychotherapy, dental treatment, dentures and orthodontics. </p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>3.  I thought there would be no waiting period. Can I still get coverage right away? </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Typically, all health insurance plans have waiting periods. But luckily, they can be waived most of the time. If you submit a claim within the first 3 or 8 months of signing up, it <i>might</i> happen that we ask for more information before paying out the claim. There are no waiting periods, if:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You had comprehensive public or private health insurance* anywhere in the world for 12 months before your private health insurance started.<br><br>To prove that, you can send us a certificate that states the start and end date of your previous comprehensive health insurance.<br><br>If your previous insurance was provided as part of a residence based statutory healthcare (e.g. NHS,Medicare) and no document can be used as proof of your previous insurance, you can ask your previous GP for this certificate/signed letter. Again, the letter needs to state the start date and the end date of your previous coverage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You have  done a medical and a dental examination to join private insurance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You had and accident and need medical treatment or hospital care <b>or</b></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You signed up more than 2 months before your delivery and you insure your newborn baby within 2 months after they are born</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Your spouse had private insurance for more than 3 months and you got private health cover as  their dependent within 2 months of your marriage (or entry into life partnership)</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If none of this evidence is available, a medical and/or dental check-up are required before your claim can be processed.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You have some questions about waiting periods or you are not sure how to waive them, our <a href=\"https://feather-insurance.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">support team</a> will be happy to help! </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>*Examples of comprehensive health insurance are private health insurance, public/statutory healthcare (e.g the NHS in the UK) and some Expat health insurances.

The goal? Getting a ballpark figure of how much funding is needed to cover their medical bills in the future. For that purpose, the providers rely on an intricate system that provides information on how likely a pre-existing condition is tied to future treatments and their cost.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This data has been collected by following the development of the conditions and their treatments by large groups of patients. With certain pre-existing conditions, it turned out that future treatment is needed more likely than not. Among these conditions are mental health issues and previous psychotherapy. As a result, the providers adapt or even deny coverage if someone applies with this background.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_c59a7e2e53\">Can't I just withhold medical information to get insurance?</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>We strongly advise against withholding information on any medical condition in the application</i>.<br>Insurance providers often communicate with your doctors about health conditions when you make a claim. If it turns out that information has been withheld about a pre-existing condition, the coverage is canceled immediately. This means you’ll be without healthcare - and switching to another provider will be extremely difficult.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_1502738902\">When is private health insurance is not an option?</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If the therapy is not yet concluded, or there were more than 25 sessions in total, private health insurance is typically not be an option.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The insurance is also not accessible if you have or had an active mental health condition like depression within the last years. The same applies for medication like anti- depressants, as their intake must have stopped more than 3 years ago.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>If your circumstances prohibit you from joining private health cover, our team is right there to check other options tailored to your personal circumstances! </i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_31fb6f35b5\">What happens if psychotherapy isn’t covered or I am denied?</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you are not satisfied with the offer, you’re able to keep your current health insurance coverage. If you’ve been denied coverage, our team is right there to check for alternative insurance options tailored to your personal circumstances.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_73bfc0dfcf\">When does it make sense to apply?</h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_455380bbff\">Requirements </h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>We would like to emphasize that coverage cannot be guaranteed in these cases and that it still depends on the provider´ s individual assessment.</i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you have received some form of therapy in the past, you can still apply, if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You had less than 5 sessions, the therapy has already come to an end and there is no plan to continue with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You had up to 25 sessions, the therapy has ended more than 5 years ago and there is no ongoing mental health conditions. </p>\n</li>\n</ul><p class=\"no-margin\">If you had a mental health condition, you can still apply, if:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There is medical proof that the condition was successfully overcome more than 3 years ago. If any medication like anti-depressants were needed, their intake must have stopped at that time as well.<br> </p>\n</li></ul><h2 id=\"h_1587036243\">The coverage might change</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you are accepted to private health insurance with a medical history in mental health or therapy, the insurance provider will most likely suggest a change of the coverage. As with some other health conditions, related treatments to your pre-existing condition will most likely not be covered.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Here is an example: You have received psychotherapy in the past, but since it was only for a handful of sessions, you can be covered under private health insurance. However, future therapy sessions will be excluded from your coverage. In case you decide to benefit from therapy again, you can still be treated, of course - but you would pay for it out of pocket. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Activating your coverage</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are two possible outcomes of the application process. If changes need to be made due to preexisting conditions, you’ll receive your new proposed coverage details and step-by-step guidance from our team through activating your coverage.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you can be covered without changes to the initial offer, your private health insurance plan will be activated automatically within a couple of days.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_f24ccb4ae7\"></h1>","author_id":5069980,"state":"published","created_at":1664891572,"updated_at":1665416223,"url":"https://faq.feather-insurance.com/en/articles/6612430-how-therapy-and-mental-health-influence-your-health-insurance-options"},{"id":"6557507","type":"article","workspace_id":"q3cgj9ue","parent_id":1634828,"parent_type":"collection","title":"How do claims work with private health insurance?","description":"","body":"<p class=\"no-margin\">If you have ever wondered how claims work under your private insurance cover, here is what you need to know!

This is usually the case if you have received a more expensive inpatient treatment at the hospital.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you expect a very costly claim of more than €1000 for outpatient treatment, we can check with the provider if they can settle it directly.

Many treatments can be performed not just by specialists but also by GPs (in Germany, many of them have multiple qualifications).

If you have ever asked yourself whether you need an insurance card for German private health insurance, the answer is generally:<br><br><b>No, you do not need a health insurance card for private health insurance</b>.<br>While an insurance card is commonly used as prove for coverage when you are under the public health insurance, this works a bit differently for private health insurance.  There are a few scenarios where you might want to prove your coverage. Have a look at the scenarios below to see what you can do!</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_55891bb2f0\">My visa appointment is coming up. How do I prove that I have health insurance?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you are covered with Feather, you can simply use the \"Confirmation of Coverage\" or the \"document bundle\" from your Feather account. Both are sufficient proof and accepted by the authorities when you apply for a visa.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you applied to private health insurance prior to July 2022, you have received the document bundle in physical form via post.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_a24a6ccf0e\">I need a medical appointment. How do I prove that I have health insurance?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Once again, you can use the \"Confirmation of Coverage\" from your Feather account. For the most part, however, not even this is necessary. You can simply let them know that you are covered under private health insurance with Hallesche and the doctors will take care of you.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_c8a1e07627\">I am pregnant and my doctors keep asking me about my insurance card. </h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you are pregnant, you will most likely go to a lot of different check-ups and preventative appointments to ensure your baby is healthy. This often means that you receive a lot of bills for the treatments. If your doctor keeps asking for a medical card when you are showing up to the pregnancy check-ups, they are most likely trying to directly bill the health insurance provider.

Why is that the case? Health insurance providers are funded through the monthly contributions they collect from the insured community. That way, if you ever need medical treatment, the provider will rely on this funding to cover you. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To get to a ballpark figure of how much funding will be needed to cover you, the provider does an initial assessment of your health when you apply. As some medical conditions are often tied to further treatment, the provider may adapt the coverage. These changes are made systematically, and the providers invest a lot of time into checking if the changes are justified.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_44e235cf30\">When is private insurance not an option?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are a couple of health conditions and treatments that always lead to a denial of coverage. Among these are asthma, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, cancer, diabetes, ADHD, mental health conditions and recent or longer-term psychotherapy. For (the combination of) other diagnoses, the providers are happy to check once the application is handed in.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_28359b2868\">What happens if I apply to Feather´s private health coverage with medical conditions?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If your medical conditions are not on the list <a href=\"#h_44e235cf30\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">above</a>, our team will do an individual check within 1 - 3 days once you hand in your application. If no changes are required, the coverage will automatically be activated - not every condition will result in a change to your original quote or coverage!</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Otherwise, the following changes can be suggested:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Risk surcharge</b><br>If you have certain conditions like knee issues, it is likely that further treatment will follow. To ensure that there´s enough funding to cover your treatment, a surcharge can be added.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Exclusion of coverage</b><br>You still enjoy a low monthly cost and pay out of pocket if you ever really need a certain treatment (for example, the replacement of a missing tooth). Please be aware that exclusions and risk surcharges may be combined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Denial of coverage</b><br>The provider denies coverage if there are certain (combinations of) conditions, since it is likely that a lot of costly claims would be made. If you cannot be covered, the Feather team will help you find an alternative!</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"no-margin\"><i>To make sure your personal circumstances are considered fairly, we cannot provide concrete information about any changes before your application is handed in - each contract is processed on an individual basis. Please be aware that private health insurance providers will not negotiate on any changes once you’ve received your revised health insurance plan. </i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_39e02a1cb5\">How does the system benefit applicants without existing conditions?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">On the flip side, applicants who are healthy (or only have a few minor conditions) benefit from a lower monthly cost tailored to their medical needs. That is why many applicants can save money when choosing private over public health insurance, where the monthly cost is only based on your income and thus often much more expensive.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_5522a0eb54\">Can´t I just omit existing conditions from the application to get covered?</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">We strictly advise against doing so. Insurance companies are really good at digging up hidden information and if it turns out that information has been left out, they will cancel the coverage. To make sure you have the right coverage from the start, our team is here to help you take the right decision. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_6adc02b3ea\">How is this different from public insurance?</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Under public health insurance, pre-existing health conditions do not play a role for the eligibility. As a result, many people with (severe) pre-existing conditions chose public insurance to make sure they are covered. Naturally, the public insurance providers still need to make sure that they have sufficient funding to cover them, especially since there are no risk surcharges. That is why each member pays a certain percentage of their income (around 14% or 7% that is split with the employer).</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>If you are not sure whether it is worth applying to private insurance, the Feather team will support you in taking the right decision.</b></p>","author_id":5069980,"state":"published","created_at":1661785218,"updated_at":1664376414,"url":"https://faq.feather-insurance.com/en/articles/6511868-pre-existing-health-conditions-and-how-they-affect-private-health-insurance"},{"id":"6482709","type":"article","workspace_id":"q3cgj9ue","parent_id":1887380,"parent_type":"collection","title":"What happens to my student health insurance after I graduate?","description":"If you’re a non-EU student who has just graduated and are looking for a job, what'll happen with your health insurance?

To take advantage of this option, you’ll need to go to the Job Center and register as a job seeker. While it doesn’t entitle you to job benefits, it does give you the opportunity to stay insured on your EHIC.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>You have a private (Incoming) insurance</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you had private (incoming / expat) health insurance while studying, it’s most likely limited to 5 years. As long as you are within this 5-year period, it <i>generally</i> meets the requirements for a job-seeking visa. Just be aware that the job-seeking visa for students is 18 months, and if your expat health insurance expires before this visa ends, it’s almost impossible to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>You are statutory insured as a student </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Your student statutory insurance will expire either when you complete your studies or when you reach the age of 30. You can, however, continue as a voluntary member; to do so, contact your insurance provider (<i>Krankenkasse</i>).</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Keep in mind that you will be paying a different amount for your voluntary insurance. This amount can vary depending on how much income you have while looking for a job (in 2022, this amount is anywhere from €166.69 to €735.30, but most recent graduates tend to pay around €180 to €200).</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Important note: </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">1. We recommend that you stay on your public health insurance after graduating, if possible. If you graduate and you switch to private health insurance (incoming or expat health insurance), you will be removed from the public healthcare system. It can be very difficult to get back into public healthcare, so we always recommend thoroughly thinking about if private is right for you before switching.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">2. If you do decide to opt-out and get private health insurance, you’ll only be able to switch back to public insurance if you have a working contract for more than €520 per month.

In this FAQ, we explain why.","body":"<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>What does it mean to downgrade health insurance?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Health insurance comes in different coverage tiers. The first is private health insurance which provides the most comprehensive coverage in Germany. The second is public health insurance which provides standard coverage. The third is expat health insurance which covers the minimum required by law. The fourth is when someone has no health insurance coverage, <b>which is illegal</b> in Germany.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To downgrade means that you’re going from private to public health insurance, from public to expat health insurance, or from public to no health insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Important information: downgrading your coverage can result in serious negative consequences for you in the future. We not only strongly recommend not doing this, but we also cannot help customers who wish to downgrade. </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>If you want to downgrade your coverage, you will need to speak to your current health insurance provider.</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>When can someone downgrade their insurance?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This is rarely possible because of Germany’s strict health insurance rules. It’s possible, but not certain, that you can downgrade from public health insurance if you’re fired and your health insurance provider accepts expat health insurance as an alternative or another limited health insurance contract. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This is incredibly unlikely to happen because your alternative insurance will be reviewed by your current health insurance provider. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>What happens if I downgrade?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">First, even if you can downgrade from public health insurance to expat or no health insurance, you might be setting yourself up for big problems in the future. If you’re switching to expat health insurance, you might have problems keeping your insurance since there is a 5-year limit. Expat health insurance is also unsuitable for anyone considering renewing their visa. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Let’s say you downgraded your insurance coverage to expat or no health insurance. If you end up getting back on public health insurance, you might be required to pay back payments. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>What are health insurance back payments?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Back payments for health insurance are required when you are either uninsured, or public health insurance refuses to accept the insurance you had while living and working in Germany. This means you’ll need to pay for public health insurance during the time you were considered uninsured in Germany, which can get pretty expensive. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Want to learn more about back payment?

Some people won’t qualify because of their income, but the plan’s price is based on your health and age at sign up. If you’re young, super healthy, and you rarely go to the doctor, you’ll most likely end up paying less for your insurance.

Here's what you need to know! </b></h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>If you have been to psychotherapy in the past, your coverage may change</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Now that you’re applying for private health insurance, you’ll need to answer a series of questions about your medical history. If you have been to psychotherapy in the past, it’s important to note that this will be considered a <b>pre-existing condition</b>. Because pre-existing conditions sometimes either lead to higher premiums, coverage exclusions, or a denial of coverage, your coverage may be personalized once you have handed in the application.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">It is not possible to give general guidelines on this as each case is treated individually, and our advice is tailored to each person. We recommend booking a call with our team to discuss the best solutions Germany has to offer for your personal demands. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Why can't I just withhold this information in the application? </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>We strongly advise against withholding information on any medical condition in the application</i>.<br>Insurance providers often communicate with your doctors about health conditions when you make a claim. If it turns out that information has been withheld about a pre-existing condition, the coverage is canceled immediately. This means you’ll be without healthcare and switching to another provider will be extremely difficult.  </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Getting your final plan and coverage details</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are two possible outcomes of the application process. If you can be covered without changes to the initial offer, your private health insurance plan will be activated automatically within a couple of days.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If changes need to be made due to preexisting conditions, you’ll receive your new proposed coverage details. At this point, the Feather Team will provide you with step-by-step instructions and guide you through activating your coverage. You’ll need to sign off on the new policy information to accept any coverage changes.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>What happens if psychotherapy isn’t covered or I am denied?</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you are not satisfied with the offer, you’re able to keep your current health insurance coverage. If you’ve been denied coverage, we offer a free additional service to check for alternatives to see if you could receive coverage from other providers.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_381a33950c\"><b>You are covered under private health insurance and want to start with psychotherapy? Here's how!</b></h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>It’s important to remember that any major treatment (i.e., psychotherapy for depression or surgery for thrombosis) can lead to your private health insurance provider requesting more information from you, your former doctors, and your current doctors. This generally happens for claims made early on during your insurance coverage and is a legal requirement. If this happens, our team will guide you through each step of the process.</i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>1. Get a referral from your general practitioner (Hausarzt)</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This is required before booking your appointment with the therapist, so your insurance provider can reimburse you.

If your therapist is located outside of Germany...</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">We will occasionally cover therapists located abroad, but you’ll need to send us a cost plan via the chat along with the name, address, type of therapy, and the referral from your general practitioner before you make the appointment. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">After you submit the information about your therapist abroad, your private health insurance provider will perform a check to validate that the therapist’s credentials meet German-approved therapy standards.

In addition, this health insurance fulfills the requirements of Article 7 (1c) of Directive 2004/38/EC (EC Free Movement Directive).</i></p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Confirmation that expat health insurance fulfills all requirements for a Schengen visa.

A minimum coverage amount of EUR 30,000.00 is guaranteed.</i></p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">While you are automatically fulfilling the Schengen requirements through your expat health insurance, the person processing your visa needs to confirm this. They are explicitly listed here in the contract to make sure the person processing your visa application can easily find them. </p>\n</li></ul><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><i>With regard to out-patient and in-patient treatment, the maximum benefit provided by the health insurance is not subject to limitation; benefits exceeding EUR 50,000.00 will also be covered. For temporary stays, this rate meets the requirements for compulsory insurance in Germany pursuant to Sections 193 (3) (1) and 195 (2) and (3) of the German Insurance Act. The deductible amounts to EUR 25.00 per insured event. The insurance coverage corresponds in essence to the scope of statutory health insurance pursuant to Section 11 (1-3) Social Security Code V (SGB V).</i></p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are specific rules in Germany for deductibles and healthcare coverage related to private health insurance plans (in this case, expat health insurance).

for your specific visa to be sure, but our general rule is that expat health insurance is almost always accepted for short stays and first visas that are valid for less than 5 years. <a

expat health insurance may or may not offer the coverage you need for your application. There is information available online to help you determine if your visa will accept expat health insurance or not.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">We recommend checking the official German Foreigner’s Office website in the city you’re applying in, which includes the list of requirements for your specific visa type. This is generally located at the bottom of the webpage, but some smaller cities don't have this document, which means expat is almost always accepted for new visas (depending on the visa type and duration). If your visa does have this document listed, you’ll need to download it (generally called “adequate health insurance”) and double-check that the expat health insurance covers what is listed in this section. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Expat health insurance does fulfill the minimum legal requirements to live in Germany. A minimum coverage amount of €30,000 is guaranteed. If you qualify for full public or private health insurance, we recommend signing up for one of those options rather than expat health insurance because these insurances are sufficient for all visa applications.

If it’s just you, then this insurance allows you to keep your current lifestyle, but it becomes more urgent the more people are reliant on your income (e.g. spouse, children, parents) and the bigger the responsibilities are (e.g. mortgage, children’s education cost).</p>\n</li></ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When does it pay out?</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you’re unable to work for more than 6 months then it pays out. If you are able to work, but in a completely different job (e.g. you’re a pianist and “only” have a problem with one of your fingers) then it also pays out unlike the government allowance.</p>\n</li></ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">How much does it pay out?</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You can decide this yourself. You can set it so be enough for basics or to cover most of your salary. In general we recommend around 60% of your brutto salary.</p>\n</li></ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">How long does it pay out?</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">It pays out for as long as you are unable to work, and until you would retire.

Here is the main reason why:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Maximum Allowable Fee Schedule</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Unfortunately, there are some dentists out there who will charge unsuspecting customers more than what is considered the 'acceptable rate.' In these cases, the dentist has raised the treatment rate beyond 3.5 times the normal rate.

But for the most part, pausing your health insurance is not an option. Let's look at a few scenarios. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"travelling-within-the-eu\">Travelling within the EU</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you're travelling within the EU, then you'll need to keep paying your monthly insurance contributions.

It's likely that you will need to cancel your German public insurance and sign up with local public insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"travelling-outside-the-eu\">Travelling outside the EU</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you're leaving the EU for a few months, then you'll still need to pay your public contributions. There's no way to put your policy on pause—and you'll probably need to get a supplemental travel insurance to ensure that you're covered while you travel.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">However, if you are relocating outside the EU for a longer period (e.g. if you're being sent abroad for work for six months or more) and plan to return to Germany, then you can apply for an <i>Anwartschaft</i> (contingent rights). This effectively puts your public insurance on hold and allows you to re-enter the public insurance system through the same insurer when you return to Germany.</p>\n<hr><p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Need help applying for an <i>Anwartschaft</i>?

Here's how.","body":"<p class=\"no-margin\">There are a number of reasons you might want to switch to a different <i>Krankenkasse </i>(public insurer). You might think that your insurer's <i><a href=\"https://blog.feather-insurance.com/public-additional-contributions/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Zusatzbeiträge</a></i> (additional contributions) are too high. Or you might find that another insurer offers better coverage for certain services than your current one. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Whatever the case, switching insurers is quite simple. All you need to do is inform your new insurer of choice that you wish to join. Once they accept you, they will inform your old insurer that you're making the change. You won't need to do anything else—but there are a few things to keep in mind about eligibility and cancellation periods.</p>\n<h1 id=\"cancellation-periods\">\n<br>Cancellation periods</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you switch insurers, a \"two months from the end of the month\" cancellation period applies with your old insurer. So if you make the request to switch on January 13th, then you will still be insured with your old insurer until March 31st—two months from the end of the month in which you requested the switch.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"eligibility-to-switch\">Eligibility to switch</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Any <i>Krankenkasse</i> has the right to deny you the right to join as a member. So even if you request to join a new public insurer, they may deny you based on factors like income or work status. In this case you would need to stay with your old insurer. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There is also a minimum contract period of 12 months with public insurers. This means that if you joined a <i>Krankenkasse</i> in July 2020, for example, you would not be able to switch to a new <i>Krankenkasse</i> until July 2021. However, if your <i>Krankenkasse</i> raises their additional contributions, this 12-month rule is voided. In this case, you have a \"special cancellation right\" until the end of the month in which the new contribution rate goes into effect. So if your insurer raised their rates starting January 1, 2021, then you can request to switch to a new insurer until January 31st.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-center no-margin\"><br><b>Need help switching insurers?

This means that you would pay the first €1000 of any eligible claims out-of-pocket. After that, your insurance will kick in and pay for 100% of eligible claims. <b>NOTE: You must still file those first €1000 in claims so your insurance company counts them toward your deductible. </b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"percent-based-deductible--copay\">Percent-based deductible + copay</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Now let's say you have a deductible of €500 with a 10% copay. This means that, for all services invoiced, you will be required to pay 10% of the total, while your insurance company pays the remaining 90%. Once your copays reach the €500 deductible amount, your insurance pays 100% of all invoices. <b>Again, be sure to keep and file those bills so your insurance company counts the amount you pay toward your deductible. </b></p>\n<h1 id=\"fixed-copay\">\n<br>Fixed copay</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Some plans, like the expat health policy, have a flat copay. In the case of expat health insurance, you must pay a <a href=\"http://faq.feather-insurance.com/en/articles/4393445-why-do-i-have-a-25-copay-for-my-claim\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">€25 copay per qualifying claim</a>.  </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"still-have-questions\">Still have questions?</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Be sure to check your insurance policy documents in your Feather account for specific information on your policies.

And when do you need to pay it?","body":"<h2 id=\"what-is-a-copay\"><b>What is a copay?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">A copay is the amount you must pay per insured event, not per claim. There can be several claims made for a single insured event (for more information, see the example below).</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">An insured event can be something like pneumonia (for Expat health insurance). </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Example: Kevin has pneumonia and goes to the doctor. He gets the bill, submits the receipt online and pays a €25 copay. Because his doctor wants to see him again shortly, he already has another appointment scheduled. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Because Kevin's pneumonia is only one insured event as it is the same sickness, he does not have to pay a copay for the second appointment. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If Kevin were still sick for the third or even fourth appointment, this would still be considered the same insured event, so he would not need to pay a copay for his pneumonia-related appointments. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If, however, Kevin had to see a doctor because he broke his arm between his pneumonia appointments, this would be considered a different insured event, and he would need to pay another copay for his doctor’s appointment for the broken arm, but not for the next pneumonia appointment.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-my-expat-health-insurance-copay-work\"><b>How does my expat health insurance copay work?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Each time you make a claim with your Expat health insurance for an insured event, you agree to pay a €25 copay toward your reimbursement. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Example: Let’s use Kevin again from the example above. Kevin decides that he wants to learn how to cook, but accidentally cuts himself when trying to get the seed out of an avocado. Medical professionals call this “avocado hand.”</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">He goes to the hospital to get stitches and submits his claim for €300 for the insured event (his cut hand). </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When he gets the direct deposit back, he’ll expect to get €275 back. He eventually goes back to get the stitches removed and is charged €150. He’ll actually get €150 back because he already paid the copay for the insured event when he got the stitches.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"who-receives-the-copay\"><b>Who receives the copay?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This copay is submitted directly to the insurer.

You can reference those in your <a href=\"https://app.feather-insurance.com/account/signin\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Feather account</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">An important detail about the expat health insurance policy is that you have accepted a 31-day insurance activation period or \"waiting period\".</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-the-31-day-waiting-period\"><b>What is the 31-day waiting period?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The activation period requires the policyholder to have an active policy for at least 31 days before making a claim. Please note that regardless of the waiting period, you would still have some limited coverage (life threatening illnesses/injuries).</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_06e3e5df93\"><b>Does the 31-day waiting period apply to everyone?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">No. There are two reasons why the waiting period can be waived:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">1) If you start an expat health insurance policy within 31 days of arriving in Germany, then no waiting period applies. For example: if you arrive by airplane to Germany on the 1st of June then you must sign up for a policy before the end of that calendar month. Keep in mind that if you do file a claim within the first 31 days of your active policy, you will need to show proof that you moved and signed up within 31 days of arriving in Germany. Proof, in this case, could include an airline, train, or bus ticket.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">2) Alternatively, if you have previous insurance of equal or greater coverage, and there is no gap in cover (so your expat insurance would start on the day of or before your previous insurance is set to expire), then the waiting period would also be waived. The same situation applies as the first point, in that if you do file a claim within the first 31 days of your active policy, you will need to show proof of your previous insurance without a gap. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-does-this-rule-exist-\"><b>Why does this rule exist?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The 31-day waiting period exists to ensure that no policy abuse occurs. If the waiting period did not exist, then it would be easy for someone who had an accident or illness to sign up for insurance and be treated on the same day—and that would make monthly payments grossly expensive for all other policyholders. For this reason, waiting periods are a common feature of many types of insurance in Germany, including health insurance and health insurance add-on policies.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Our expat health insurance relies largely on the honor system to get you insured—generally, we don't require applicants to submit a medical report or have a doctor's exam before taking out a policy with us. That's why we can get you insured in minutes! But we need to put mechanisms in place to ensure no abuse of the insurance policy occurs.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_78dd34bf30\"><b>What happens I were to become seriously ill or have a major accident during the waiting period?</b></h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In the case of a major incident such as an accident or sudden affliction, the waiting period would be waived and you would receive the necessary treatment.

Some people are <i>freiwillig versichert</i> (voluntarily insured) and some people are <i>pflichtversichert </i>(mandatorily insured). </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The difference between being voluntarily and mandatorily insured is that the people who are voluntarily insured have the choice to be insured through the public health insurance system or one of the many private health insurance providers while anyone who is mandatorily insured <b>must</b> be insured through the public health insurance system. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">A yearly income threshold of €66,600 (in 2023) has to be passed for someone to be able to get private health insurance, but unlike public health insurance where your monthly premium depends on your income, private health insurance premiums are determined by your age and health when signing up. Depending on your tax bracket, this means the highest someone will ever pay for public health insurance is €769.16 per month (which is pretty high). </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">That’s why many people look at switching to private health insurance which can be significantly cheaper and offer added coverage benefits like the ability to see a chiropractor, dental insurance, vision insurance, and no more recommendation from your general practitioner to see a specialist doctor. There are, however, a few downsides: you need to file a claim for reimbursement and pay out-of-pocket for most procedures, switching back to public can be difficult depending on your situation, certain pre-existing conditions may not be covered, your dependents each have their own monthly premiums, etc. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>Self-employed and freelancers are always voluntarily insured</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">That means they almost always have the choice of which insurance they want to get.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Sometimes, however, public health insurance will deny someone’s application for coverage if they’re voluntarily insured. Private health insurance can also deny that person’s application (for things like pre-existing conditions or freelancers who earn less than €30k per year), which leaves them with only a select few options for insurance (which tend to be quite expensive unless they have been in Germany for less than 5 years). </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">For people who are not eligible for private, public, expat, or cannot afford other health insurance options, we recommend that you consider taking a full-time job at a German company to switch to public insurance before continuing your self-employment or freelancing. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>The requirements of getting public health insurance while voluntarily insured</b></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">The rules to get this type of public insurance are pretty complicated and strict. These are the requirements to get into voluntary insurance. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You have to decide to join the public insurance within 3 months of coming to Germany. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You have to have previous public insurance history in Europe</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Option 1) You are publicly insured in Europe at the moment for at least 12 months consecutively and decide to switch to a German public insurance provider</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Option 2) You have been publicly insured in a European country for more than 24 months in the last 5 years.

Well, if you don't speak German and you don't know what <i>Sozialversicherungsnummer</i> means, then you might be completely lost. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_18500ffe22\">So, what's a Sozialversicherungsnummer?</h1>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Fortunately, it's not that difficult. Your <i>Sozialversicherungsnummer </i>(SVNR) is your German pension number. Everyone in Germany who is employed needs an SVNR. This number keeps track of what your employer is paying into your pension. This number is unique and will stay with you for all your life.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Anytime you start a new job, your employer will ask you for this number.

But if you're signing up for private insurance, then the system is a little different. You or your employer will have to request the SVNR. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Luckily, if you’re signing up for private insurance, we’ve simplified this step for you. By using the link below, you can request the SVR directly from the officials. They will send it to you by post at your registered address.
